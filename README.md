# DWERFT Import/Export tools

# Scope

This project intends to provide samples demonstrating how to connect various tools to the linked production data cloud (lpdc). The tools in question are all used for film making. The aim is to extract as much meta data from the tools and store it in the lpdc. Next, this meta data is to be exported from the lpdc back to the tools, selecting only the data required by each.

# Linked Production Data Cloud

The lpdc stores all data using a custom ontology which is still subject to changes and a triple store. It supports SPARQL queries.
